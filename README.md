# Annotated-papers

This is an effort inspired from @AakashKumarNain 's [Annotated Research Papers](https://github.com/AakashKumarNain/annotated_research_papers).
I've started reading research papers on daily basis. This repository will serve as a central directory for me and everyone else, to grab a copy of annotated paper, if you are short on time and want to review it!

I'm not as good at annotating, but I'm trying!!
